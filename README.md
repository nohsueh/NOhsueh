> There is a scene in the animal world. A herd of sika deer runs across the continent, followed by a herd of lions. Suddenly, a sika deer is caught and the lions begin to enjoy it. When the herd noticed that the deer had been caught, they stopped running and watched the lion nibble on the deer. Day after day, until the earth is destroyed.
